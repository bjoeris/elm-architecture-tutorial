# Typing Test

This is a simple program to test typing speed.

* To begin, open index.html.
* Challenge paragraphs are taken from input.txt. Separate challenge paragraphs are separated by at least one blank line (as in LaTeX)
* In some browsers, security settings might prevent it from loading input.txt, in which case the text area will be blank. To fix this, you can use a different browser, or run a simple HTTP server. With python installed, you can simply run
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
and then open up a browser and go to (http://localhost:8000).
